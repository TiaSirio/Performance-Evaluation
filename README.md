# Assignments Performance Evaluation And Application 🚀

Explore a series of challenges in Performance Evaluation and Applications through this repository.

## Technologies Used 💻

This repository leverages the power of two key technologies for performance evaluation:

### MATLAB 📈

MATLAB, a widely-used numerical computing environment, provides a robust platform for analyzing data, creating models, and conducting simulations. Its versatility makes it an invaluable tool for tackling a variety of challenges in performance evaluation assignments.

### JMT (Java Modeling Tools) ☕

Java Modeling Tools (JMT) is a suite of software tools that support the modeling, design, and analysis of performance models. Offering a Java-based environment, JMT facilitates the exploration of complex systems, enabling a comprehensive approach to performance evaluation tasks.
